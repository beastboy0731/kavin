    <h3>
      Thor grew into a mighty warrior and protector of his home and people. Thought to be rash and even reckless by his father, Thor nevertheless looked forward to the day of his ascension to the throne. But, his adoptive brother Loki schemed in private to ensure that day never arrived. He manipulated Thor into attacking the Frost Giants, legendary adversaries of the Asgardians and Lokiâ€™s people, and Odin divested Thor of his magic hammer Mjolnir and banished him to Midgard, the realm also known as Earth.
